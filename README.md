#train report, reservation ticket which will have train no and name, date of journey, boarding station, 
#destination station, person name, age, [censored], total fare and a unique PNR no.

#The main aim of the project was to develop a website which would facilitate the reservation of online air tickets through an effective and 
#yet simple GUI for a normal passenger intending to travel in airways. 
#Apart from reserving tickets, through our system a passenger can compare online fares ‘from’ various cities ‘to’ various cities.
